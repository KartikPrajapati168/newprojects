                            Finding my soulmate on Shaadi.com felt like a dream. I'd nearly lost hope of falling in love and marrying, but then Vishal messaged me. Our connection was instantaneous; conversations flowed endlessly, and soon, we were envisioning a shared future. Excitedly, we introduced each other to our families, who wholeheartedly supported our union. Now happily engaged, we await our wedding day, excited to start our journey together. Shaadi.com turned our dream into reality, bringing us together in a bond stronger than anything in the universe. We found not just a partner, but a soulmate.</span>

                            It's all about our love story.
                            Alankar was a paid member and mine was a free account. I remember it was something special slot during which I could text to paid members. I am thankful to Shaadi.com because I only got the opportunity to talk with Alankar on that day. We exchanged our numbers. Our first conversation started on July 11, 2022. We talked over the call for 3 hrs and that day itself I was sure he was the perfect better half for me. We decided to take time and once we were both sure about each other as partners, then we would only inform both families. After that, we used to talk daily. In the 3rd month, we both informed our parents. We were both doing good in terms of our careers, but both of us had family responsibilities, so we decided to get married in 2022 as well, but that also got delayed due to unavoidable medical circumstances of  few family members. Although we both belong to Maharashtra, our hometown is almost 400 km away from his place. So it's a kind of two-state story only. Our family meets in jan 2023 and that day, with  the blessing of our parents,our wedding dates have been fixed. We got engaged on 26th April 2023 and happily got married on 27th April 2023.
                            We are forever grateful to Shaadi.com because of Shaadi.com we met, and now we are happily married.
                            Thank you very much Shaadi.com</span>

                        <span class="detail">We started conversing through messages on the platform, discussing various topics ranging from our hobbies to our aspirations for the future. As we continued to communicate and get to know each other better, we realized that we had a strong connection and shared many common goals and values.

                            Eventually, we decided to take our conversations offline and met in person. The chemistry we felt online translated seamlessly into real-life interactions, and we quickly realized that we had found someone special. Thanks to Shaadi.com, we were able to find each other amidst the vast sea of profiles and embark on this beautiful journey together."</span>

Then on a normal day, on my Shaadi.com account, I came across Sanjula  profile and I just had to message her.Little did I know we would instantly click and exchange number. We spoke to each other all the time even given the time difference. Our feelings grew stronger and it all happened naturally without any pressure. It got to a point, we both felt we could not imagine our lives without each other. We told our families and then they spoke, then we met each other on 15 September 2023. Our feelings grew and we both knew that we wanted each other for life. So then came 26th November 2023 and we got engaged &amp; on 19 January 2024 we became Husband and Wife.</span>
